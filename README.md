# Hellcat-v2-VLESS-Trojan-traffic-tester-tool
Hellcat is a simple, reliable Go-based traffic generator for benchmarking and testing proxy infrastructure. It supports VLESS and Trojan protocols over TCP or WebSocket (with optional TLS/WSS), runs many concurrent clients, and randomizes UUID, SNI and WS paths to better emulate real user traffic.
